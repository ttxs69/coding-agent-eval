name: self-improve
description: Use when the user wants to proactively push a project forward by implementing its next feature. Reads project artifacts (specs' "future work" sections, README, TODOs, recent commit trajectory, codebase gaps), infers candidate features, asks the user to pick one, then implements it on an isolated branch with verification + review + merge-gate. Triggered by /self-improve or phrases like "implement next feature", "push project forward", "evolve".

# Self-Improve

Autonomously scan a project for improvements and apply each as an isolated, verified, reviewed branch. Asks the user before merging anything.

## When to invoke

- User types `/self-improve`, `evolve`, `self-evolve`, `improve this project`, `auto-improve`, or similar phrases
- User asks for an autonomous code-improvement / bug-sweep / refactor pass

Do **not** invoke for:
- Single targeted edits — just do the edit directly
- Unscoped "make it better" requests when the user is unwilling to merge multiple branches
- Projects with uncommitted changes — refuse and ask the user to commit/stash first

## Auto-detection (run at workflow start)

Detect from project files; do **not** read CLAUDE.md for config:

- **Language/runtime**: `pyproject.toml` → Python+uv; `package.json` → Node; `Cargo.toml` → Rust; `go.mod` → Go
- **Test command**: derive from language (`uv run pytest`, `npm test`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`). If none detected, the verify step skips test execution and candidates requiring test evidence are deprioritized
- **Linters/type-checkers**: detect from config (`ruff`/`mypy` from pyproject; `eslint`/`tsc` from package.json; `clippy` for Rust)
- **Default branch**: read via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`; fall back to `main`, then `master`. **Never hardcode** — used as merge target in step 8

## Per-run setup (once)

1. Read `.claude/self-improve-state.md` if it exists (missing → treat as empty)
2. Scan `git log` for already-merged `self-improve/*` branches as a backstop
3. Verify working tree is clean: if dirty, **refuse to start**, tell user to commit/stash
4. Ensure the workflow's own artifacts are gitignored: check the project's `.gitignore` for `.claude/self-improve-state.md`, `.claude/self-improve-state.md.tmp`, and `.claude/worktrees/`. If any are missing AND the project has a `.gitignore`, append the missing entries with a comment like `# self-improve skill runtime artifacts`. If the project has no `.gitignore`, create one with these entries. This prevents the state file from being silently committed on the next `git add -A`.

## Workflow (per-iteration loop)

Each iteration produces one branch and asks the user whether to merge. Loop until a stopping criterion fires.

### Step 1: Scan

Gather signals:
- Linter / type-checker output (run them, parse errors/warnings)
- Test failures (run the test command, capture which tests fail)
- `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` / `XXX` comments (grep)
- Missing tests (coverage tool if available; else heuristic: public functions with no test references)
- Dead code (unused imports, unreferenced functions)
- Duplication / complexity hotspots
- Dependency freshness + known CVEs (read lockfile; check against registry if cheap)
- Docs gaps (public APIs without docstrings; missing README sections)
- Recent git churn (files changed in last N commits — regression-prone areas)
- Anything project-specific discovered at runtime

### Step 2: Pick next candidate

Filter out:
- Candidates matching the state file's *Attempted* or *Permanently Rejected* sections (match on category + files + idea similarity)
- Candidates matching already-merged `self-improve/*` branches in git log

Rank remaining by `impact × ease × low-risk`:
- **Impact order**: correctness → security → tests → perf → refactor → deps → docs
- **Ease**: cheaper/faster first
- **Risk**: lower-risk first (smaller diffs, more isolated changes)

Take the top candidate.

### Step 3: Isolate

Use `superpowers:using-git-worktrees`. Create:
- Worktree at `.claude/worktrees/<slug>`
- Branch `self-improve/<category>/<slug>-<ts>` (e.g., `self-improve/bug/pytest-parse-error-20260614-103045`)

### Step 4: Apply

Invoke the matching skill:
- Bug → `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
- Missing test / test-included fix → `superpowers:test-driven-development` (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Refactor → `superpowers:simplify` (or `superpowers:code-review --fix` if available)
- Docs / deps / perf → plain editing

### Step 5: Verify

Use `superpowers:verification-before-completion`:
- Run the affected tests
- Run the full test suite if cheap (under ~30s)
- Run linters/type-checkers
- **No claiming success without evidence** — paste the actual command output

If no test command detected (e.g., docs-only repo), skip test execution, rely on linters, and note in the state record.

### Step 6: Review

Use `superpowers:requesting-code-review` (or the project's `/code-review` skill if available).

If **neither** is available, do an inline self-review against this checklist:
- Correctness: does the change do what it claims?
- Regressions: could this break existing behavior?
- Scope creep: does the diff include unrelated changes?
- Security: any new attack surface?

Note in the state record that no formal review skill ran.

If review finds real issues: fix (one retry), then re-review. If still rejected, skip the candidate.

### Step 7: Commit

Use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` for guidance. Commit to the branch with a conventional-commit message:

```
<type>(<scope>): <summary>

Self-improve: <category>

[body explaining the change]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

Do **not** push.

### Step 8: Offer merge

Surface the branch with a one-line summary, then ask the user (use AskUserQuestion):

> Branch `self-improve/<category>/<slug>` ready.
> Change: <one-line summary>
>
> Merge to <default-branch> now, defer, or skip?

- `merge` → switch to the detected default branch, merge (fast-forward if possible, else `--no-ff`). **Do not push** without an explicit ask. After successful merge: delete the worktree and the merged branch.
- `defer` → leave branch and worktree in place, continue to next iteration. Surface again in end-of-run summary.
- `skip` → leave branch for manual review, delete the worktree (branch stays so the user can find it). Mark in state as "left for manual".

### Step 9: Record

Update `.claude/self-improve-state.md` (see format below):
- Append to *Attempted*: `<iso-ts> | <category> | <branch> | <status> | <summary>`
- If user said "never do this kind of change", move to *Permanently Rejected*

Statuses: `merged` | `deferred` | `skipped-tests-failed` | `skipped-review-rejected` | `skipped-other`

### Step 10: Loop or stop

Check stopping criteria. If continuing, re-scan from step 1 (applying one improvement may surface or fix others).

## Stopping criteria

Any one triggers end-of-run:
1. No candidates found after scan
2. Max iterations reached — default **10** (configurable: `self-improve max=20`)
3. **3 consecutive failures** — counts as failure: `skipped-tests-failed`, `skipped-review-rejected` (after retry), `skipped-other` from apply-produces-no-change, worktree-creation-failed. `deferred` or `merged` resets the counter
4. Token budget hit — default **500K total** (configurable: `self-improve budget=1M`)
5. Wall-clock budget — default **30 min**
6. User interrupts (Ctrl-C / Escape)

## Error handling

| Failure | Action | State status |
|---|---|---|
| Working tree dirty at start | Refuse to start, tell user to commit/stash | (no entry) |
| Worktree creation fails | Log, skip candidate, continue | `skipped-other` |
| Apply produces no change | Log, skip, continue | `skipped-other` |
| Tests fail after apply | Revert worktree, continue | `skipped-tests-failed` |
| Review rejects (after one retry) | Leave worktree for inspection, continue | `skipped-review-rejected` |
| Merge conflict during merge step | Abort merge, leave branch for manual review | `deferred` |
| State file missing/corrupt | Warn, start fresh | (reset) |

**Interrupt handling:** On Ctrl-C / Escape, clean up current worktree (try/finally), write partial state, print summary of what was completed.

## Safety rails

**Never touch:**
- `.git/`
- User / system config under `.claude/` — `settings.json`, `settings.local.json`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `plugins/`. (Exception: this skill's own artifacts at `.claude/self-improve-state.md`, `.claude/self-improve-state.md.tmp`, and `.claude/worktrees/` are managed by the workflow itself.)
- `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`
- `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `build/`
- Lockfiles (`uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`) unless the candidate is explicitly a `deps` change

**No external-state mutations** — refuse to run:
- `npm publish`, `pip upload`, `cargo publish`
- `git push`, `git fetch` with rewrite
- `terraform apply`, `kubectl apply`, `docker push`
- Anything else that affects systems beyond the local repo

**Per-file change cap per run:** default 3 — if the same file has been edited 3 times this run, skip further candidates touching it.

**Worktree cleanup always runs** (try/finally), even on failure.

## State file format

Path: `.claude/self-improve-state.md` (auto-added to `.gitignore` during per-run setup — local automation state).

```markdown
# Self-Improve State

Tracks candidates the workflow has considered, so repeated runs don't redo work.
Safe to delete — workflow will recreate.

## Attempted

One line per attempt: `<iso-ts> | <category> | <branch> | <status> | <summary>`

Statuses: `merged` | `deferred` | `skipped-tests-failed` | `skipped-review-rejected` | `skipped-other`

- 2026-06-14T10:15:22Z | bug | self-improve/bug/pytest-parse-error-20260614-101522 | merged | Fixed off-by-one in test nodeid parser (cae/parsers.py:42)

## Permanently Rejected

Format: `- <summary> — <reason>. Decided <date>.`

- Pin pytest to <8 — won't fix; conflicts with astropy-build extra. Decided 2026-06-13.
```

**Atomic writes:** write to `.claude/self-improve-state.md.tmp`, then atomic rename. Avoids corruption if interrupted mid-write.

**Same-candidate matching:** same file(s) + same category + semantically similar idea. Fuzzy by design — judge similarity from summary text and file list, not hash matching.

## End of run

Print a summary:

```
Self-improve run complete.
- Iterations: N
- Branches created: M (list names)
- Merged: X
- Deferred: Y (list names for review)
- Skipped: Z (with reasons)

Next steps:
- Review deferred branches: git checkout <branch>
- Re-run anytime: /self-improve
```
